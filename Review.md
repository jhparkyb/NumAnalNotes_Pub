### Lecture 03 opening

#### Review of Lecture 02

1. Python basics
   - `list`
     - Modification is in-place.
     - Slicing
   - `tuple`
     - Similar to `list` but more compact.
     - immutable.
   - `dict`
     - Access *value* by *key*.
     - Modification is in-place.
   - `list`- and `dict`-comprehension
   - Copy vs assignment (passing by reference)
   - Packing and unpacking
   - Loop over both
     - index and element of `list` --> `enumerate`
     - key and value of `dict` --> `dict.items()`

#### Feedback

1. Does slicing make a copy?
   - 'Yes' for `list`, while
   - 'No' for `numpy.ndarray`
   - We will discuss in more detail next lecture.

#### Today

- Taylor theorem and big-oh notation


### Lecture 02 opening

#### Review of Lecture 01

1. Programming general
   - Use standard terminology. (e.g., 'Python list' rather than 'collection', 'key of a Python dictionary' rather than 'name of a dictionary data')
   - Pay attention to data type. (e.g., `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `int`, `float`, etc)
1. Python basics
   - Explicit function vs anonymous function (`lambda`)
   - f-string

#### Today

- Finish Python basics (Data types of Python)
- As much as NumPy basics
