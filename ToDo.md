  - [x] Dahlquist barriers
- [x] Stiffness

### Correction/Clarification

- [x] Add the definition of $\Pi_n$--exactness.
- [ ] range of maximum of (d/dt)^3 f(t,x(t))
- [ ] typo (t_{n-1},x_{n-1})

### Good to have, not necessary

- [ ] Different conventions between PyTorch and NumPy
    - [ ] ~~Add comments where the differences are relevant.~~ --> Add hyperlinks to the summary block (One source principle)
    - [ ] Add a summary block that collects the differences.
