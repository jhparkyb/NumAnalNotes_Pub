    "- The above table summarizes approximate complexity rather than very precise ones. The reason we have $2kn^2$ additional term for multiple problems using LU decomposition (compared to a single problem) is that we need to compute two more substitions ($Lc=b$ and $Ux=c$) for each problem. On the other hand, for Gaussian elimination, we have to recompute all over again for each problem, hence complexity $(2/3) kn^3$.\n",
    "- The multiple problems scenario ($Ax_i=b_i$ for $i=1,2,\\cdots,k$) is common in applications because it is often the case $A$ comes from discretizing the integral or differential operator that governs the application and $b$ comes from different data. For example, accoring to Sauer (2017), in structural engineering, $b$ is called *loading vector* and the solution $x$ gives *stress*. We may want to see how stress looks like for many different loading vectors."
