    "- There is another stability issue, different from zero-stability, related to *stiffness*.\n",
    "- Stiffness leads to a concept *A-stability* or *linear stability*. However, we do not pursue this in this course. Just be aware of this issue.\n",
    "- Stiffness forces small step sizes for many numerical methods, making many methods useless.\n",
    "- Generally speaking, explicit methods are unfavorable for stiff problems while implicit methods work better. Implicit Euler method and BDF2 is among the most robust method in this regard.\n"
